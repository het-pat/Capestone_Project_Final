Data can answer question which are unimaginable and non answerable by humans because humans do not have the tendency to analyze such large dataset and produce analytics to find a solutions.\nLet's consider the base scenario:\nSuppose I want to find a restaurant, then logically, I need:                                                               \nIts geographical coordinates(latitude and longitude) to find out where exactly it is located.\n\nTo access location of a restaurant, its Latitude and Longitude is to be known so that we can point at its coordinates and create a map displaying all the restaurants with its labels respectively.\n\nData collection :\n\nFor this project I used this dataset of New York City\nhttps://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572\n\n"
