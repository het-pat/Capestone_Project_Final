With an estimated 2019 population of 8,336,817 distributed over about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.\n\nProblem description:\nSuppose I travel and keep changing places very frequently. This is very hectic and plus i get to experience very different types of environment, of which I do not have much knowledge about. In such situation, food can be an important factor for decided how you rate your trips and plus also recommending it to the people. Food can also attract people around to world to try it out if it were to be the best. In such scenarios, we need to find the right place, at reasonable cost, to serve us the best possible way. So there are few questions that must be addressed, such as:\n1.\tHow many types of foods are available in the restaurant?\n2.\twhich is the nearest to me with good rating?\n3.\tHow many \"similar\" restaurants are available nearby me?\n4.\tCan we find any veg restaurant?\nTo address such question, XXYZ company's manager decides to allocate this project to me not just to find out solutions to the questions but also build a system that can help in recommending new places based on their rankings compared to the previously visited by me.\nExpectations from this recommender system is to get answer for the questions, and in such a way that it uncovers all the perspective of managing recommendations. It is sighted to show:\n1.\tWhat types of restaurants are present in a area?\n2.\twhere are the similar restaurant present based on a preference to particular food?\n3.\tHow do different restaurants rank with respect to my preferences?\nTarget audience:\nTarget audiences for this project does not limit to a person who keeps travelling but everyone. People could simply decide to look for a similar restaurant all the time because they are addicted to a specific category of food. People who rarely use restaurants would prefer to have the most rated restaurants nearby them and all this could be easily handled by our recommender system. So target for this project is basically everyone who is exploring different places or similar places.\nSuccess rate:\nWith restaurants evolving, new food categories emerge, hybrid food starts to be more popular, we need a system that could help us access vast number of food varieties. It is impossible for a person to ask each and everyone about their visit to a particular place and also not everyone remembers everything. On the other hand, Computers are good at remembering things, and with Machine learning to its peak, it high time technology will by our personal guidance and help us personally based on our likes and dislikes. So people would care about this project as their personal assistance and success rate could certainly increase with time.\n"
